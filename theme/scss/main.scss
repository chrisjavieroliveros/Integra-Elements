/**
 * Project: SMACSS SCSS Architecture
 * Description: This project implements a scalable and modular architecture for CSS (SMACSS) 
 *              using SCSS to ensure maintainable and reusable styles.
 * Author: Chris Javier Oliveros
 * Version: 2.0.0
 * License: MIT
 * 
 * This file serves as the entry point for the SCSS architecture. It organizes and imports 
 * all styles based on the SMACSS methodology.
 * 
 * NOTE: This compiles to main.css and should be used alongside config.css
 * (compiled from config.scss) which contains all CSS custom properties.
